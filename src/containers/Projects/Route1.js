                Route1 is a mid-stage, white-collar recruitment technology
                startup, with a team of around 15. They supply B2B web based
                data products to law and accountancy firms, as well as a B2C
                native mobile app.

                They hired me as their Chief of Technology mid-2016 and was
                responsible for product development, and leading teams across
                design &amp; technology. I frequently pitched to decision makers
                at legal and accountancy firms for new clients, as well as to
                European venture capital groups for funding.
